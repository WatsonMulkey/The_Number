WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES:
======================================================================

During onboarding, the following data is saved to the database:

SETTINGS TABLE (encrypted):
  - onboarded: true
  - budget_mode: "paycheck"
  - monthly_income: 3000.0
  - days_until_paycheck: 15

EXPENSES TABLE:
  - Rent: $1,500.00 (fixed)
  - Utilities: $200.00 (fixed)
  - Groceries: $300.00 (variable)

CALCULATION:
  Remaining = $3,000 (income) - $2,000 (expenses) = $1,000
  Daily Limit = $1,000 / 15 days = $66.67

THE NUMBER = $66.67
