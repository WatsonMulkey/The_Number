## Brand Identity & Positioning

### The Relationship: FOIL Industries ↔ The Number

**FOIL Industries** creates tools that make you better by solving complex problems with simple solutions. **The Number** is the purest expression of this philosophy applied to personal finance.

```
FOIL Industries = Sophisticated industrial workshop
The Number = The one perfect tool from that workshop
```

**Analogy**: If FOIL Industries is a master craftsman's workshop filled with precision instruments, The Number is the single, perfectly balanced tool you grab every morning—so intuitive it becomes an extension of your hand.

### Brand Positioning Statement

**The Number** is a budgeting companion for people who find traditional budgeting overwhelming or invasive. It's the anti-spreadsheet—giving you exactly what you need (one daily spending number) without the guilt, complexity, or surveillance of conventional money apps.

**For**: Adults (25-45) who want financial control without financial obsession
**The Number is**: A daily financial compass, not a budget prison
**That**: Delivers clarity and calm through radical simplicity
**Unlike**: Mint, YNAB, EveryDollar (exhaustive tracking, category overload)
**The Number**: Respects your privacy, your time, and your intelligence

### Brand Sentiments Hierarchy

**PRIMARY** (The Number's core personality):
1. **Calm** — Budgeting shouldn't spike your cortisol
2. **Clear** — One number, zero confusion
3. **Respectful** — Your data, your rules

**SECONDARY** (Inherited from FOIL):
4. **Smart** — Sophisticated math, simple interface
5. **Honest** — No dark patterns, no upsells
6. **In Your Corner** — A tool that wants you to win

**Aesthetic Keywords**: Spacious, legible, breathing room, morning light, clarity, confidence

## Color System

### Philosophy: Light Touch, Heavy Impact

The Number uses a restrained palette anchored by **soft, optimistic neutrals** with strategic FOIL accents for credibility and warmth. The overall feel should be *airy* and *uncluttered*—like a clean kitchen counter with one beautiful object on it.

### Primary Palette

#### **The Number Green** (Brand Foundation)
```
Sage Green (Primary)
HEX: #E9F5DB
RGB: 233, 245, 219
CMYK: 5, 0, 11, 4

USE FOR:
- Primary background for key moments (onboarding, success states)
- Highlighted "today's number" containers
- Positive feedback (e.g., "You're on track!")
- Accent borders and subtle gradients

PSYCHOLOGY: Growth, calm, fresh start, organic, non-judgmental
AVOID: Large solid fills on mobile (can feel washed out); use as panels or gradients
```

#### **Charcoal** (Inherited from FOIL)
```
Deep Neutral
HEX: #2B2E33
RGB: 43, 46, 51
CMYK: 16, 10, 0, 80

USE FOR:
- Primary text on light backgrounds
- App headers/navigation (sparingly—mostly use white)
- "Powered by FOIL Industries" lockup
- Dark mode primary background

PSYCHOLOGY: Grounded, serious, trustworthy, industrial
```

#### **Warm White** (Canvas)
```
Off-White (Primary Background)
HEX: #FAFAF8
RGB: 250, 250, 248
CMYK: 0, 0, 1, 2

USE FOR:
- Primary app background (80% of screen real estate)
- Card backgrounds
- Negative space (crucial for calm aesthetic)

PSYCHOLOGY: Clean, breathable, premium paper quality
NOTE: Never pure white (#FFFFFF)—too clinical
```

### Secondary Palette (FOIL Accent Colors)

#### **Slate Blue** (Strategic Accent)
```
FOIL Heritage Blue
HEX: #4A5F7A
RGB: 74, 95, 122
CMYK: 39, 22, 0, 52

USE FOR:
- Secondary CTAs (e.g., "View Details")
- Interactive elements (toggles, sliders in neutral state)
- Data visualization (spending trends)
- FOIL branding moments

AVOID: Primary CTAs (too corporate for The Number's vibe)
```

#### **Mustard** (Energy Accent)
```
FOIL Signature Gold
HEX: #D4A017
RGB: 212, 160, 23
CMYK: 0, 25, 89, 17

USE FOR:
- Achievement moments ("Week completed!")
- Important alerts (not errors—use Terracotta)
- Highlighted numbers when over budget (urgency without panic)
- Sparingly in icons

PSYCHOLOGY: Attention, warmth, optimism
CONTRAST REQUIREMENT: Always pair with dark text (Charcoal #2B2E33)
```

#### **Terracotta** (Warmth & Alerts)
```
FOIL Warmth
HEX: #C96A5A
RGB: 201, 106, 90
CMYK: 0, 47, 55, 21

USE FOR:
- Gentle error states ("Budget exceeded, but you've got this")
- Delete/destructive actions (use outline, not solid)
- Humanizing accent in illustrations

AVOID: Traditional "red error" panic—keep it warm, not alarming
```

### Functional Palette

#### **Success Green** (Confirmation)
```
HEX: #7CAF5C
RGB: 124, 175, 92
USE FOR: Transaction saved, goal hit, positive reinforcement
```

#### **Soft Gray** (Inactive States)
```
HEX: #D4D8DC
RGB: 212, 216, 220
USE FOR: Disabled buttons, placeholder text (at 60% opacity)
```

### Color Usage Ratios (Mobile Screen)
- **Warm White**: 70% (dominant breathing room)
- **Sage Green**: 15% (strategic highlighting)
- **Charcoal**: 10% (text, navigation)
- **FOIL Accents (Slate/Mustard/Terracotta)**: 5% (surgical precision)

### Accessibility Requirements

**Minimum Contrast Ratios** (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance):
- Body text: 4.5:1 (Charcoal #2B2E33 on Warm White #FAFAF8 = 12.6:1 ✓)
- Large text (18pt+): 3:1
- Interactive elements: 3:1

**Test Combinations**:
- ✓ Charcoal on Warm White: 12.6:1 (excellent)
- ✓ Slate Blue on Warm White: 5.8:1 (good for UI elements)
- ✗ Sage Green on Warm White: 1.3:1 (decorative only, never text)
- ✓ Mustard on Charcoal: 4.9:1 (acceptable for large text)

**Color Blind Considerations**:
Never rely on Sage Green alone to convey information. Pair with:
- Icons (checkmark for success)
- Position (top = good, bottom = needs attention)
- Text labels

---

## Typography

### Philosophy: Warm Intelligence

The Number's typography balances **human warmth** (serifs) with **crisp clarity** (sans-serifs). Where FOIL Industries uses the geometric precision of Space Grotesk throughout, The Number softens the edges with a serif for moments of trust and connection.

### Primary Typeface: Scope One

**Scope One** (Google Fonts: Serif, 400 weight only)

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789 $€£¥

WHY THIS CHOICE:
✓ High x-height for mobile legibility
✓ Distinctive personality (not generic fintech)
✓ Single weight keeps file size minimal (PWA performance)
✓ Warm, slightly bookish—evokes ledgers and trust
✓ Differentiates from FOIL's modernist Space Grotesk
```

**USE FOR**:
- **"The Number" itself** (the daily budget display): 48-72pt, Charcoal
- Onboarding headlines: 28-36pt
- Feature explanations: 18-22pt
- Any moment where warmth > efficiency

**PAIRING LOGIC**:
Scope One says "a person made this for you."
Space Grotesk (used in FOIL lockup) says "this was engineered to work."
Together = trustworthy precision with a human heart.

### Secondary Typeface: Inter

**Inter** (Google Fonts: Sans-serif, weights 400, 500, 600)

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789

WHY THIS CHOICE:
✓ Designed for screen clarity (OpenType features for legibility)
✓ Tabular figures (numbers align vertically in lists)
✓ Neutral enough to let Scope One be the star
✓ Extensive weights for hierarchy without new font files
✓ Similar to Space Grotesk (both geometric sans) but more utilitarian
```

**USE FOR**:
- UI labels and buttons: Inter 500 (medium), 14-16pt
- Body text, transaction lists: Inter 400 (regular), 16pt
- Input fields: Inter 400, 18pt (larger for accuracy)
- Navigation: Inter 600 (semibold), 12pt uppercase

### Typographic Hierarchy

**Level 1: The Number (Hero Display)**
```
Font: Scope One
Size: 72pt mobile / 96pt tablet
Weight: 400 (only available weight)
Color: Charcoal #2B2E33
Line Height: 1.1 (tight, it's a single line)
Letter Spacing: -0.02em (slightly tighter for elegance)
Context: Today's available spending number—this IS the app
```

**Level 2: Section Headers**
```
Font: Scope One
Size: 28pt mobile / 36pt tablet
Weight: 400
Color: Charcoal #2B2E33

```

**Level 3: Subheads / CTAs**
```

Size: 16pt
Weight: 600 (semibold)
Color: Charcoal #2B2E33 or Slate Blue #4A5F7A
Line Height: 1.4
Letter Spacing: 0.01em
Transform: Sentence case (not all caps—friendlier)
Context: Button labels, form labels
```

**Level 4: Body Text**
```
Font: Inter
Size: 16pt (never smaller on mobile)
Weight: 400
Color: Charcoal #2B2E33
Line Height: 1.6 (generous for readability)

```

Line Height: 1.5

```

### Special Typography: Numbers

**Financial Figures** (amounts, currency):
- **Font**: Inter (tabular figures enabled)
- **Weight**: 500 for amounts under $1,000; 600 for larger
- **Size**: 20pt minimum for primary amounts
- **Color**: Charcoal (never red/green for amounts—color blind accessible)
- **Format**: `$1,234.56` (comma separators, always 2 decimals)

**Currency Symbol Styling**:
- Same size as figures (don't superscript)
- Same weight
- Position: Leading (`$50.00` not `50.00$`)

### Font Loading Strategy (PWA Performance)

**Priority 1 (Inline Critical CSS)**:
```css
/* Load immediately */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Scope+One&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600&display=swap');
```

**Fallback Stack**:
```css
font-family: 'Scope One', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
```

**Loading Behavior**:
- Show fallback immediately (no FOIT—flash of invisible text)
- Swap to web font when loaded (acceptable brief reflow for brand consistency)

---

## Visual Language

### Design Principles

**1. One Thing at a Time**
Each screen has a clear primary action. No competing CTAs. The eye should know where to land instantly.

**2. Generous Space is a Feature**
White space isn't wasted—it's the pause between thoughts. Aim for 60-70% negative space on any screen.

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
Show the number. Hide the complexity. Advanced features exist behind a tap, never on the main screen.

**4. Calm Interactions**
No confetti, no sudden animations. Transitions should feel like breathing: smooth, natural, unforced.

### Layout System

**Grid Foundation** (Mobile-First):
```
Container: 100% width, 16px horizontal padding
Maximum width: 480px (center on larger screens)
Vertical rhythm: 8px base unit (all spacing is multiples of 8)

Spacing Scale:
- xs: 8px (tight element spacing)
- sm: 16px (default component padding)
- md: 24px (between sections)
- lg: 40px (major section breaks)
- xl: 64px (page-level separation)
```

**The Number Display** (Hero Element):
```
Position: Top third of screen, horizontally centered
Background: Sage Green #E9F5DB panel
Padding: 40px vertical, 24px horizontal
Border Radius: 16px (soft, approachable)
Shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(43, 46, 51, 0.08) (subtle lift)

Typography:
"You have" — Inter 400, 16pt, Charcoal at 70%
"$127.50" — Scope One 400, 72pt, Charcoal
"to spend today" — Inter 400, 16pt, Charcoal at 70%
```

**Card Style** (Transactions, Settings Panels):
```
Background: Warm White #FAFAF8
Border: 1px solid #E8EAE6 (barely visible structure)
Border Radius: 12px
Padding: 16px
Shadow: None (flat, let content hierarchy create depth)
Hover/Active: Border → Slate Blue #4A5F7A
```

### Motion & Animation

**Philosophy**: Calm, purposeful, never gratuitous.

**Micro-interactions**:
```
Button Press:
- Scale: 0.98 (subtle shrink)
- Duration: 100ms
- Easing: ease-out

Screen Transitions:
- Type: Slide (right to left for forward, left to right for back)
- Duration: 250ms
- Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) (Material Design standard)

Number Update (daily refresh):
- Type: Fade out old → Fade in new
- Duration: 400ms
- Easing: ease-in-out
- Avoid: Flip counters, slot machines (too gamified)
```

**Loading States**:
- **Skeleton Screens**: Gray placeholder shapes (not spinners)
- **Color**: Soft Gray #D4D8DC with 1s pulse animation
- **Copy**: "Calculating your number..." (Inter 400, 16pt, Charcoal at 50%)

## Iconography & Imagery

### Icon Style: Outline with Purpose

**Aesthetic**: Geometric, hand-drawn quality—slightly imperfect to avoid sterile tech vibes.

**Specifications**:
- **Style**: Outline (2px stroke weight)
- **Corner Radius**: 2px on interior corners
- **Color**: Charcoal #2B2E33 (default), FOIL accents for specific meanings
- **Size**: 24x24px base unit (scale to 32px, 48px as needed)
- **Library**: Heroicons (outline set) or custom-drawn to match

**Current Icons**:

*House* (Expenses):
```
Meaning: Fixed costs, recurring expenses, stability
Color: Slate Blue #4A5F7A
Usage: Expense category header, onboarding
Visual: Simple gabled roof, single door, welcoming
```

*Dollar Sign* (Transactions):
```
Meaning: Spending, income, money movement
Color: Charcoal #2B2E33 (neutral, not green = income red = expense)
Usage: Transaction list, add transaction button
Visual: Clean $ with even vertical strokes
```

**Expanded Icon Set** (for feature growth):

*Calendar* → Recurring expenses
*Pie Chart* → Spending insights
*Shield* → Privacy settings
*User Circle* → Account/profile
*Plus Circle* → Add transaction (not just "+")
*Checkmark Circle* → Success, goal achieved
*Settings Gear* → App settings
*Eye Slash* → Privacy ("No tracking" messaging)

**Icon Usage Rules**:
1. **Never use icons alone** (always pair with text label)
2. **Consistency**: Same icon = same meaning throughout app
3. **Spacing**: 8px between icon and label
4. **Alignment**: Center icon vertically with accompanying text cap height

### Illustration Style

**Philosophy**: Minimal, warm, human without being literal.

**When to Use**:
- Empty states ("No transactions yet")
- Onboarding flow (guide, not decorate)
- Error screens (soften frustration)
- Achievement moments (celebrate without gamification)

**Style Attributes**:
- **Line Art**: 2-3px organic strokes (hand-drawn feel)
- **Color**: 2-3 colors max (Sage Green + Slate Blue + Charcoal)
- **Complexity**: Simple shapes—no gradients, no shadows
- **Subject Matter**: Abstract concepts (paths, connections, containers) over literal objects
- **Reference**: Illustrations in Notion, Linear—calm, conceptual, not cartoonish

**Example Illustration**: "No Transactions Yet" Empty State
```
Visual: Open hand with a single coin hovering above palm
Colors: Hand outline in Charcoal, coin in Mustard
Message: "Add your first transaction to see your number update"
```

### Photography (If Needed)

**Unlikely use case**, but if needed for marketing:
- **Style**: Natural light, airy, soft focus backgrounds
- **Color Grading**: Warm neutrals, slight green tint (match Sage palette)
- **Subject**: Hands holding phone, coffee on desk, morning routines (not corporate stock photos)
- **Composition**: Negative space dominant (60% empty space minimum)

## Tone & Voice

### The Number's Personality

If The Number were a person, they'd be the friend who tells you the truth kindly, celebrates your wins without judgment, and never makes you feel bad about a setback.

**Core Attributes**:
- **Honest**: No sugar-coating, but no shame either
- **Encouraging**: Assumes you're trying your best
- **Concise**: Respects your time (3-sentence max for any explanation)
- **Grounded**: No hype, no financial jargon

**NOT**:
- ❌ Gamified ("You leveled up! 🎉")
- ❌ Parental ("You shouldn't have spent that")
- ❌ Guru-ish ("Here's the secret to wealth...")
- ❌ Corporate ("Optimize your financial wellness journey")

### Voice Guidelines

**FOIL Industries Voice** (for comparison):
- Authoritative, confident, industrial
- "We engineer solutions to complex problems"
- Speaks to makers, doers, professionals

**The Number Voice**:
- Conversational, calm, present-tense
- "Here's what you can spend today"
- Speaks to anyone who's tired of budgeting guilt

**Sentence Structure**:
- **Short sentences**: 8-15 words average
- **Active voice**: "You have $127 left" not "There is $127 remaining"
- **Direct address**: "You," "Your," never "The user"
- **Contractions**: "You're on track" not "You are on track" (warmer)

### Messaging Framework

**Onboarding Copy**:
```
✓ "Budgeting, simplified. We'll calculate one number: how much you can spend today."
✗ "Welcome to The Number! Get ready to transform your financial life with our revolutionary approach!"

✓ "We only need three things: your income, your expenses, and your name. That's it."
✗ "To provide you with a personalized budgeting experience, we'll need to collect some information."

✓ "Your data stays on your device. No tracking, no selling, no surprises."
✗ "We take privacy seriously and comply with all applicable data regulations."
```

**Daily Number Reveal**:
```
Above the number:
✓ "You have"
✗ "Today's available spending amount is"

Below the number:
✓ "to spend today"
✗ "remaining in your daily budget allocation"
```

**Success States**:
```
✓ "You're on track for the week."
✗ "Congratulations! You've successfully maintained your budget!"

✓ "Week complete. Nice work."
✗ "Achievement unlocked: Budget master!"
```

**Error States** (when over budget):
```
✓ "You're over by $23 today. Tomorrow's a fresh start."
✗ "Warning: You have exceeded your budget limit."

✓ "Happens to everyone. Want to adjust your expenses?"
✗ "Error: Insufficient funds allocated for this period."
```

**Empty States**:
```
✓ "No transactions yet. Add one to see your number update."
✗ "You haven't added any transactions. Tap the + button to get started!"
```

**Confirmation Messages**:
```
✓ "Saved."
✗ "Your transaction has been successfully recorded!"

✓ "Expense updated."
✗ "Changes to your expense have been applied to your budget."
```

### Word Choice Glossary

**Use** → **Avoid**
- "Your number" → "Your budget" (softer, less restrictive)
- "Expenses" → "Bills" (broader, less negative)
- "Transactions" → "Spending events" (simpler)
- "Update" → "Modify" / "Edit" (friendlier)
- "You're over" → "Deficit" / "Overdrawn" (less financial jargon)
- "Add" → "Input" / "Enter" (more human)

### Punctuation & Formatting

**Periods**: Use for complete sentences. Skip for short labels ("Add transaction" not "Add transaction.")

**Exclamation Points**: Maximum one per screen. Reserve for genuine wins only.

**Question Marks**: Avoid rhetorical questions ("Ready to save money?"). Use for actual choices ("Delete this expense?")

**Numbers**:
- Spell out one through nine ("three expenses")
- Numerals for 10+ ("15 transactions")
- Always numerals for currency ("$5" not "five dollars")

**Capitalization**:
- Sentence case for all UI (not Title Case)
- Proper nouns: "The Number," "FOIL Industries"
- Never ALL CAPS for emphasis (use bold)

## Brand Relationship Strategy

### The Hierarchy: FOIL Industries ← The Number

**Analogy**: Apple (parent) ↔ iPhone (product)

FOIL Industries is the maker. The Number is the made. Users don't need to think about FOIL constantly, but when they do, it should reinforce trust and quality.

### Visibility Guidelines

**High FOIL Visibility** (Credibility Moments):

*Splash Screen* (app launch, 1 second):
```
Layout:
  [The Number logo/wordmark]
  [12px vertical space]
  "A FOIL Industries Product" — Inter 400, 12pt, Charcoal at 60%

Background: Warm White #FAFAF8
No animation (loads fast, professionals don't wait)
```

*About / Settings Page*:
```
Section: "About The Number"
Copy: "The Number is built by FOIL Industries—a company that makes tools to help you be better. We believe complex problems deserve simple solutions. Learn more at foilindustries.com."

Visual: Small FOIL logo (monochrome, Charcoal) 40x40px
Link: Tappable, opens foilindustries.com in new tab
```

*App Store Listing* (Marketing):
```
Developer Name: "FOIL Industries"
Subtitle: "A different way to budget—from the makers of tools you trust"
Description: Lead with The Number benefits, close with FOIL credibility
```

**Low FOIL Visibility** (Day-to-Day Use):

*Main Dashboard*: No FOIL branding (The Number stands alone)

*Onboarding Flow*: Mention once on welcome screen ("Made by FOIL Industries"), then focus on product

*Transaction Screens*: Zero FOIL presence (user is focused on their money, not branding)

### Co-Branding Lockup

**Primary Lockup** (for marketing, splash screen):

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   THE NUMBER            │  ← Scope One, 36pt, Charcoal
│   ─────────             │  ← 2px line, Mustard #D4A017, 40px wide
│   A FOIL Industries     │  ← Inter 400, 12pt, Charcoal at 60%
│   Product               │
└─────────────────────────┘

Spacing: 8px between "THE NUMBER" and line, 4px between line and FOIL text
Alignment: Left-aligned (feels more editorial/crafted)
Background: Always Warm White or Sage Green (never Charcoal—needs contrast)
```

**Minimal Lockup** (for settings, footers):

```
"Built by FOIL Industries" — Inter 400, 12pt, Charcoal at 50%
(Just text, no logo, no decoration)
```

### When FOIL Brand Elements May Be Used

**ALLOWED**:
- ✓ Charcoal color (shared neutral, not distinctive)
- ✓ Slate Blue / Mustard / Terracotta as accents
- ✓ "A FOIL Industries Product" text lockup
- ✓ Small monochrome FOIL logo in About section

**RESTRICTED** (Permission Required):
- ⚠ FOIL tinfoil texture (too industrial for calm budgeting app)
- ⚠ Space Grotesk font (only if Inter can't handle a use case)
- ⚠ "Tools that make you better" tagline (too broad for single-purpose app)

**FORBIDDEN**:
- ✗ Full FOIL wordmark replacing "The Number" branding
- ✗ FOIL's slate/mustard as The Number's primary colors (must remain accents)
- ✗ Corporate FOIL messaging in user-facing copy

### Cross-Promotion Strategy

**Within The Number**:
- Settings → "More from FOIL Industries" link (goes to FOIL product page)
- If other FOIL products launch: Subtle banner ("Check out [Product], another FOIL tool")

**On FOIL Industries Website**:
- Products page features The Number prominently
- Use The Number's Sage Green + Scope One to differentiate from other FOIL products
- Messaging: "Our first consumer app, built on our philosophy of radical simplicity"

**Email/Support Communications**:
- From: "The Number by FOIL Industries" <watson@foil.engineering>
- Email signature: The Number logo + small FOIL logo
- Tone: Use The Number's conversational voice, sign off with FOIL credibility

## Application Guidelines

### Mobile-First Principles

**Screen Sizes** (Responsive Breakpoints):
```
Mobile (Primary): 375px - 767px
Tablet: 768px - 1023px
Desktop (Rare): 1024px+

Design for 375px first (iPhone SE), enhance larger.
```

**Touch Targets**:
- Minimum size: 44x44px (Apple HIG) or 48x48px (Material Design)
- Spacing between tappable elements: 8px minimum
- Primary CTA: 48px height minimum

**Thumb-Friendly Zones**:
- Place primary actions in bottom third of screen (natural thumb reach)
- Top third: Display info only (The Number, context)
- Middle third: Scrollable content (transactions, settings)

### PWA-Specific Considerations

**App Icon** (Home Screen):
```
Sizes: 192x192px, 512x512px (Android), 180x180px (iOS)
Design:
  - Background: Sage Green #E9F5DB
  - Foreground: "TN" monogram in Scope One, Charcoal
  - Shape: Let OS apply mask (square, rounded square, circle)
  - Safe area: Keep critical elements 10% inset from edges
```

**Splash Screen**:
```
Background: Warm White #FAFAF8
Content: The Number wordmark + "A FOIL Industries Product"
Duration: <1s (technical loading only, not artificial delay)
```

**Offline Functionality**:
- Messaging: "You're offline. Data will sync when you reconnect." (Inter 400, 14pt, Charcoal at 60%)
- Visual: Small icon (cloud with slash) next to message
- Behavior: App remains fully functional (local data only)

**Performance Budget**:
- Total page weight: <500KB (initial load)
- Font files: <100KB combined (Scope One + Inter subset)
- Images: WebP format, <50KB each
- Animation: CSS transforms only (no JavaScript for 60fps)

### Dark Mode (Future Consideration)

**Philosophical Question**: Should a calm, breathing-room app have dark mode?

**Recommendation**: Not initially. The Number's identity is tied to lightness, white space, morning clarity. Dark mode risks feeling like every other fintech app.

**If implemented later**:
```
Background: Charcoal #2B2E33
Card Background: #353940 (lighter than BG)
Primary Text: #F0F0ED (warm off-white)
Sage Green: Deepen to #C1D4AC (same hue, lower luminosity)
Disable: Pure black backgrounds (too harsh, causes eye strain)
```

### Print Guidelines (Rare, but possible)

**Use Cases**: Support docs, marketing one-sheets

**Color**: CMYK values provided in Color System section
**Typography**: Scope One for headlines, Inter for body (both have print-safe fallbacks)
**Logo**: Use co-branding lockup, ensure 0.5" minimum width
**Paper**: Uncoated matte (matches warm, tactile brand feel)

## Accessibility Standards

### Commitment

The Number is built for everyone. Accessibility isn't a checklist—it's about respecting every user's ability to manage their money with dignity.

### Visual Accessibility

**Color Contrast** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA):
- ✓ All text: 4.5:1 minimum (7:1 for Level AAA where possible)
- ✓ UI components: 3:1 minimum
- ✓ Tested combinations listed in Color System section

**Color Independence**:
- Never use color alone to convey meaning
- ✓ "Over budget": Show amount in Terracotta + up arrow icon
- ✗ "Over budget": Show amount in red only

**Typography**:
- Minimum size: 16px body text (exception: 14px for metadata if 60%+ contrast)
- No italics for body text (harder to read, especially for dyslexia)
- Line height: 1.5-1.6 (generous spacing aids comprehension)
- Line length: 65 characters maximum

**Focus States**:
```css
Interactive elements must have visible focus:
- Outline: 2px solid Slate Blue #4A5F7A
- Offset: 2px from element
- Contrast: 3:1 against background
- Never: outline: none; (unless custom focus style provided)
```

### Motor Accessibility

**Touch Targets**:
- 48x48px minimum (exceeds WCAG 2.5.5)
- Spacing: 8px between targets

**Gestures**:
- No swipe-only interactions (provide button alternative)
- No multi-finger gestures (pinch, two-finger scroll)
- Timeout: None (user controls pace)

### Cognitive Accessibility

**Simplicity**:
- One primary action per screen
- Consistent patterns (same icon = same action throughout)
- Undo available for destructive actions

**Language**:
- 8th-grade reading level or below
- Active voice, short sentences
- Avoid idioms / financial jargon

**Predictability**:
- Navigation always in same location
- Back button works as expected (browser history)
- No auto-play animations (user triggered only)

### Screen Reader Support

**Semantic HTML**:
```html
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer> (not <div class="header">)
<button> for actions (not <div onclick="">)
<input type="number"> for amounts (not text)
```

**ARIA Labels**:
```html
<!-- The Number display -->
<div role="region" aria-label="Today's available spending amount">
  <p aria-hidden="true">You have</p>
  <p class="the-number" aria-label="$127.50">$127.50</p>
  <p aria-hidden="true">to spend today</p>
</div>

<!-- Icon buttons -->
<button aria-label="Add new transaction">
  <svg aria-hidden="true"><!-- plus icon --></svg>
</button>
```

**Alternative Text**:
- Decorative images: `aria-hidden="true"` or `alt=""`
- Informative icons: Descriptive alt text
- Illustrations: Convey meaning, not description (alt="No transactions added yet" not "Drawing of a hand holding a coin")

### Testing Checklist

**Before Launch**:
- [ ] Run axe DevTools (automated accessibility testing)
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- [ ] Navigate entire app using keyboard only (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- [ ] Test with 200% browser zoom (text should reflow)
- [ ] Simulate color blindness (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia)
- [ ] Test in bright sunlight (outdoor contrast check)
- [ ] User test with at least one person with disabilities
