# Best Practices Review

Before beginning or resuming work on this project, review the comprehensive best practices guidelines to ensure alignment with established patterns and avoid known pitfalls.

## Instructions

1. Read the BEST_PRACTICES.md file in the project root
2. Identify which sections are most relevant to the current task:
   - AI Integration (for resume generation, AI-powered features)
   - API Design (for backend work)
   - Frontend Architecture (for Vue/UI work)
   - Testing Strategy (before writing tests)
   - Security Practices (always relevant)
   - State Management (for Pinia/state work)
   - Error Handling (for any user-facing features)
   - Performance Optimization (for optimization tasks)

3. Highlight any relevant patterns or anti-patterns from the guide
4. Check if the current task involves any of the "Common Pitfalls" documented
5. Reference specific sections using file_path:line_number format when applicable

## When to Use This Skill

- Starting work on a new feature
- Resuming work on an existing project after a break
- Before making architectural decisions
- When encountering a problem that may have been solved before
- During code review to validate against established patterns

## Output Format

Provide a brief summary (3-5 bullet points) of the most relevant best practices for the current task, including:
- Applicable patterns to follow
- Known pitfalls to avoid
- Security considerations (if relevant)
- Testing requirements (if relevant)
- Links to specific sections in BEST_PRACTICES.md

Keep the review concise and actionable - focus on what's immediately relevant to the current work.
